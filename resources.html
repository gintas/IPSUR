As of Fall, 2010, I have been recording my STAT 3743 course lectures as part of a team initiative at YSU to develop a distance education program in Statistics.  There are a lot of challenges associated with something like that, particularly with respect to the integrity of the academic climate.  It's a can of worms, to be sure. But I am coming to the opinion that it just might be possible to make it work, and R may very well be just the right tool for the task. We'll see.

In the meantime, the bottom line for you, the user, or the instructor, is a fair amount of supplementary resources.  That means video lectures (in a bunch of FREE formats), scanned lecture notes, course outlines, source code for assessment materials such as labs, quizzes, and exams, blank versions that a person can modify for other courses, and all of it accompanies a FREE textbook, to boot.

The current place to find everything is here:

If the location changes then I will post any updates on this page. Not everything is finished; I will complete it as time permits. These materials are a work in progress so please excuse any roughness around the edges (it is astonishingly easy to forget to turn on that stupid microphone).
