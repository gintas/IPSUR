I would be happy to hear any (most?) comments, suggestions, problems, questions, or requests that you may have about <code>IPSUR</code>. And if you would like to ask/say something, then it would be better to ask/say it on the <code>IPSUR</code> mailing lists (or my personal address) rather than bog down an already busy R-help mailing list.  There are two <code>IPSUR</code> specific mailing lists for this purpose.

If you have a question about how to use, install, download, or otherwise operate <code>IPSUR</code>, then please write to the <code>IPSUR-help</code> list at <a href="mailto:ipsur-help@lists.r-forge.r-project.org">ipsur-help@lists.r-forge.r-project.org</a>.  It is a moderated list, which means that you need to register to be able to post messages freely.  If you are not registered then every message  you send will need to be approved in advance (by me) before it will be posted to the list and stored in the archives. Visit <a href="https://lists.r-forge.r-project.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/ipsur-help">here</a> for registration instructions;  don't worry, it is quick and painless.

Please note that <i>questions about the exercises</i> are <i>intentionally deleted</i> from the list of appropriate questions.  As a general rule I <i>will not</i> answer questions about the exercises (or other conceptual matters).  You should already have your own professor to teach you probability and statistics, and (s)he is the one being paid to do it, not me.

<p>
If you find a mistake in the narrative, if you have a suggestion regarding the subject matter, or if you have <i>constructive</i> criticism of the book, then please let me know on the <code>IPSUR-devel</code> list at <a href="mailto:ipsur-devel@lists.r-forge.r-project.org">ipsur-devel@lists.r-forge.r-project.org</a>.  This is also a moderated list;  go <a href="https://lists.r-forge.r-project.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/ipsur-devel">here</a> to register.  Before writing please bear in mind that regarding subjective matters I do pledge to amicably listen to - but I do not promise to agree with - everybody about everything.  Moreover, the fact that <code>IPSUR</code> is FREE means that if you don't like something then you are FREE to rewrite it yourself.  All that being said I would be happy to hear about your experiences with the book, good or bad, in the classroom or elsewhere.
